# Strawberry-Disease-Pest-Nutrition-Detection
This AI model automatically detects the disease, the pests and the nutritional deficiency in Strawberry plants and fruits.

To integrate the AI model into any robot, app, website, browser or server, I have given sample code in the example folder.

The AI takes any picture or video of strawberry field / plant/ fruit as input as is able to tell if it's healthy, or has diseases, or has pests or has any nutrient deficiency.

In a live robot, it helps the robot to provide input to the decision tree, suporting the farmer as well as optimizing it's own operations like UVC or localised orgnanic sprays or
laser burn.
